## 1. Project overview

This project implements least-effort path planning in a SimpleGrid grid environment, using a classical planner (such as Fast Downward). It also compares two acting strategies (Run-Lookahead and Run-Lazy-Lookahead). Each grid cell encodes terrain difficulty; moving into a cell adds its cost to the plan. The planner minimizes total cost to reach the goal, and an acting loop executes the plan.

We will use an existing grid simulator (i.e., SimpleGrid) rather than building one from scratch. A small translator will export the simulator state to PDDL (objects, adjacency, per-cell costs) and import the resulting plan back into the simulator. This keeps modeling simple and leverages classical planners’ strength at path search. 

### 1.1 Research question
How does terrain difficulty, represented as action cost, affect planning and acting performance?

### 1.2 Comparison
We compare Run-Lookahead and Run-Lazy-Lookahead on planning time, total effort, plan length, and number of replans. We expect Run-Lookahead to replan more and achieve lower total cost, while Run-Lazy-Lookahead plans faster but may yield higher cost.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1 System Overview

- Planner: a classical PDDL planner, SimpleGrid (i.e., an existing grid simulator)
- Acting: Run-Lookahead vs Run-Lazy-Lookahead
- Metrics: planning time, total effort, plan length, replans
